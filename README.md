# Clickstream Data Processing

This project demonstrates a real-time data processing pipeline for analyzing user behavior using Scala, Apache Kafka, and Apache Spark. The pipeline ingests clickstream data, enriches it, performs sessionization, aggregation, and stores the processed data for further analysis.

## Introduction
Many organizations collect clickstream data from their websites or applications to gain insights into user behavior. This project showcases how Scala, Apache Kafka, and Apache Spark can be used to build a robust data processing pipeline to analyze clickstream data in real-time.

The pipeline performs various tasks including data enrichment, sessionization, aggregation, and storing the processed data. By leveraging the power of Scala, Kafka, and Spark, this project provides a foundation for understanding and implementing clickstream analysis at scale.

## Prerequisites
Before running this project, ensure that you have the following prerequisites:

- Apache Kafka: [Installation Guide](https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/)
- Apache Spark: [Installation Guide](https://spark.apache.org/downloads.html)
- Scala: [Installation Guide](https://www.scala-lang.org/download/)

## Installation
Follow these steps to set up the project:

### Clone the repository:
   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/ClickstreamDataProcessing.git
 ```
 
### Install project dependencies: 
   ```shell
      cd ClickstreamDataProcessing
      # Run the command to install dependencies (e.g., using sbt or Maven)
   ```
## Usage 
1. Start Apache Kafka and create a topic to store clickstream data
2. Configure Apache Spark to collect with Kafka for Data ingestion.
3. Ingest Clickstream Data:
      * Run the kafka producer program in scala to simulate or collect clickstream data. Configure the producer tos send data to kafka topic creaed in step 1.
4. Data Processing Pipeline:
      * Write Spark Streaming code in Scala to consume clickstream data from Kafka.
      * Perform data enrichment tasks such as IP address lookup, user agent parsing, etc.
      * Transform and cleanse the data as required.
      * Define sessionization logic based on your business requirements.
      * Group clickstream data into sessions based on user activity patterns and assign session IDs.
      * Aggregate the clickstream data within each session and calculate relevant metrics.

5. Storing Processed Data:
      * Choose a storage system like Apache Hadoop, Apache HBase, or a database of your choice.
      * Store the processed clickstream data for further analysis.

5. Analysis and Visualization:
      * Use Scala, Apache Spark, or any other data analysis tool to perform further analysis on the processed clickstream data.
      * Visualize the results using libraries like Matplotlib, Tableau, or Apache Superset.
